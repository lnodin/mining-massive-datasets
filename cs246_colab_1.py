# CS246 - Colab 1
## Wordcount in Spark

### Setup

Let's setup Spark on your Colab environment.  Run the cell below!

"""If you executed the cells above, you should be able to see the file *pg100.txt* under the "Files" tab on the left panel.

### Your task

If you run successfully the setup stage, you are ready to work on the *pg100.txt* file which contains a copy of the complete works of Shakespeare.

Write a Spark application which outputs the number of words that start with each letter. This means that for every letter we want to count the total number of (non-unique) words that start with a specific letter. In your implementation **ignore the letter case**, i.e., consider all words as lower case. Also, you can ignore all the words **starting** with a non-alphabetic character.
